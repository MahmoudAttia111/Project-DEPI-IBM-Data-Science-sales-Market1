 my project in DEPI about sales market data science by python 
 Market Sales Prediction
This project focuses on predicting sales for a variety of products using machine learning models. The goal is to explore relationships between different features, apply feature engineering techniques, and develop predictive models to forecast sales more accurately.

Project Overview
The Market Sales Prediction project is a data science solution aimed at predicting sales for products across various outlets. By understanding the key drivers behind sales performance, this project helps optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and promotional efforts.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: Big Mart Sales Prediction Dataset

The dataset used in this project has the following columns:

Item_Identifier: Unique identifier for each item.
Item_Weight: Weight of the item (some missing values).
Item_Fat_Content: Indicates whether the item is low fat or regular.
Item_Visibility: Percentage visibility of the item in the store.
Item_Type: Category/type of the item (e.g., Dairy, Meat).
Item_MRP: Maximum retail price of the item.
Outlet_Identifier: Unique identifier for each outlet.
Outlet_Establishment_Year: Year when the outlet was established.
Outlet_Size: Size of the outlet (some missing values).
Outlet_Location_Type: Tiered categorization of the outlet's location.
Outlet_Type: Type of outlet (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket).
Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the item at the respective outlet (target variable).
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/khalledhelmy/Market_Sales_Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Market_Sales_Prediction
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) includes:

Distribution analysis of numerical features
Correlation analysis between features and sales
Visualization of sales trends by product type and outlet type
Feature Engineering
In this project, we performed several feature engineering steps:

Imputation of missing values for Item_Weight
Imputation of missing values for Outlet_Size
Handling categorical variables with encoding techniques
Modeling
We trained and evaluated several machine learning models:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and RÂ².

Results
The best-performing model was Ridge, achieving an R2 of 0.75 on the test data.
